# Inception
This project is more like an introduction to the Docker and the containerization world, the project simply aims to building an application with the help of docker, the application made of three containers: mariadb as a database, nginx as a web server, and wordpress for creating and managing a website.
For someone who is familliar with docker, they know that this project might take up to 10 mins to be ready and running, especially with the needed basics, simply because the images of those containers we need are already ready to use and available for free in the DockerHub, the project is dedicated for a better learning and deeper understanding of Docker, that's why building our own images was mandatory, and the only thing we were allowed to use ready is the base images (alpine or debian). That took more time to get into the final point, but with benifits and good understanding of how this really work.
I have made a more detailed readMe for anyone who is willing to take the same adventure or who wants to aquire this deeper understanding, it can be found on [my Notion page.](https://power-dianella-94f.notion.site/Inception-da5e3503356a4ce193e7cd0402ce03e8)
